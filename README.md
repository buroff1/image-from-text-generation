## 🗺️Overview

This project develops a text-to-image generation model that translates textual descriptions into corresponding images using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.

## 👨‍💻Technologies

- **TensorFlow**: Main framework for building the model.
- **Python**: Programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and testing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pillow**: For image processing tasks.
- **TQDM**: For providing progress bars in loops.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests in Python.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning tools.
- **Gradio**: For building a web interface to interact with the model.
- **COCO Dataset**: Utilized for training and validating the model performance.

## 👀Features

- **Dynamic Image Generation**: Transforms text descriptions into high-quality images using CNNs and Transformers.
- **Interactive Model Training**: Detailed workflow in Jupyter Notebook using the COCO dataset for training and validating.

## 🗃️Project Structure

- **`image-generation-from-text-gui.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for training the model and generating images using CNNs and Transformers.

## 🛠Setup and Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/buroff1/image-from-text-generation.git
cd image-from-text-generation
```
2. **Download the COCO dataset**:
- Visit [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#download) and download the `train2017` images and the `annotations` folder.
- Ensure these are placed within a `data/` directory in the project root.
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Open the `image-generation-from-text-gui.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions within to train the model and generate images using CNNs and Transformers.
